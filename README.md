# Continuous Assessment 3 - Django Test and Security
For my CA3 project, I created a test folder to store all my tests. Within that folder, the files I have created are: `test_models.py`, `test_urls.py`, `test_settings.py`, `test_login.py` and `test_signup`.

- test_models.py:

		- I wrote test cases to verify the behavior of the Question and Choice models in the polls app. 

- test_urls.py:

		- I wrote test cases to verify that the URL patterns in the polls app are resolving to the expected views.These tests helped me to ensure that the routing in the app is set up correctly and that URLs are resolving to the appropriate views.


- test_settings.py:

		- basically, it tests to see if the secrete_key is valid or not, I should not include your SECRET_KEY, as that would defeat the purpose of keeping it secret. Instead, I could create a separate .env file and set a unique SECRET_KEY value for that file. After that, I could add it to my .gitignore. But for purpose of learning, I am doing it as simply as possible.


- test_login.py and test_signup.py:

		- This is using a testing framework like Selenium, which allows me to simulate the user interactions with the website and test its functionality.
		

- 'django.middleware.security.SecurityMiddleware':

		- The middleware provides security features for your application, such as setting HTTP headers to protect 	against common attacks like cross-site scripting (XSS), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), and clickjacking.


These tests provide a safety net for my CA3 project, helping me catch bugs and regressions as I make changes to the codebase.
